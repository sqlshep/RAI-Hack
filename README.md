2. Navigate to the newly cloned folder in Jupyter or VS Code and select the folder of the project you would like to work on, "Education_Story", "Finance_Story" or "Healthcare_Story".  Then select the .ipynb notebook in that folder and start working.

   Keep in mind that each notebook takes about 30 minutes in total to run. While it is running you can monitor the model training and dashboard creation phase in the AML portal under Pipelines, there will be two pipelines created.
