## Steps to create a Financial News Classification Promptflow 

- Once you have created the Financial News Classification workflow using [guide](./creatingClassificationflow.md), you should proceed to create an Evaluation flow in order to perform a bulk test and assess the performance of the LLM model.

- To create the Evaluation flow, you will need to click on the "**Create**" button on the prompt page. Once you click on the button, a page will open up displaying various flow options. From there, please select the "**Evaluation**" section, as indicated in the screenshot. In the "Classification Accuracy Evaluation" box, please click on the "**View Details**" button to access more information and insights.

- After clicking on the "View Details" button, a new page will open up. In this page, simply click on the "Clone" button, as depicted in the screenshot.

- After cloning the flow, a Classification Accuracy Evaluation flow will open up, resembling the screenshot. Here, you need to make a few changes to easily utilize the Financial News Classification flow for accuracy calculation.

- Next steps are to update the `grade.py` file, please replace it with the provided [file](/news_article_classification/promptflow_classification/promptflow_scripts/test_scripts/grade.py) or make the necessary modifications as required. After updating the `grade.py` file with the new Python file, please validate the inputs again. You will notice that the "Validate and parse input" button is enabled, so go ahead and click on it.

- If the groundtruth and prediction are already in the correct order, then you don't need to make significant changes. You can proceed with the existing order for accurate evaluation.

- You can now proceed with the execution of the flow by clicking on the 'Run' button as there are no more changes left. After clicking on the "Run" button, the execution proceeds in the correct order, as shown in the screenshot, without any errors.
