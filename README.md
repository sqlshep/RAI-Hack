1. From your Azure Machine Learning compute instance 

  Clone the following github repo 
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ResponsibleAIAccelerator
  ```

2. Navigate to the newly cloned folder in Jupyter or VS Code and select the folder of the project you would like to work on, "Education_Story", "Finance_Story" or "Healthcare_Story".  Then select the .ipynb notebook in that folder and start working.

   Keep in mind that each notebook takes about 30 minutes in total to run.
